## Overview

"Collaboration Station" is a SaaS wiki app that I created during my time at Bloc. This is a Wiki application in which users can browse, create, and edit public Wikis. It also allows user to upgrade their account using Stripe. This allows users to create private wikis while also adding the ability to collaborate with other users.

## Personal Learning Objectives

My main goal for this app was to learn how to integrate MongoDB into my apps. I also wanted to improve my overall understanding of routes, controller actions, and utilizing DRY code. 

## User Stories

* As a User, I want to be able to sign up for a free account by providing user name, email, and password.
* As a User, I want to be able to sign in and out of Blocipedia.
* As a User with a standard account, I want to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Public Wikis.
* As a User, I want a User Profile to display and edit personal Wikis.
* As a Developer, I want to offer three user roles: Admin, Standard, or Premium.
* As a Developer, I want to seed the development database with users and wikis.
* As a User, I want to create wikis using Markdown syntax.
* As a User, I want to upgrade my account from a Standard to Premium plan.
* As a Premium User, I want to create private wikis.
* As a Premium User, I want to add and remove collaborators from my private wikis.

## Conclusion

Learning to use MongoDB was a great introduction into the world of NoSQL databases. It was suprising to learn how different they were from traditional databases. Learning how to use and interact with NoSQL databases will help me further my web development career.
