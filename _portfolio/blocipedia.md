# Overview

"Easy Analytics" is an analytics service and reporting tool that you can use with web apps to track user activity and report results. This app is a server side API, client-side Javascript file to track web activity, and a web-accessible dashboard to vizulize event data. 

## Personal Learning Objectives

For this project my goal was to learn how to build an API the "rails way", by focusing on namespacing and AJAX requests. 

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a name, password, and email  
* As a user, I want to sign in and out of Blocmetrics 
* As a user, I want to register an application with Blocmetrics for tracking
* As a user, I want events associated with registered applications
* As a developer, I want to receive incoming events in an API controller
* As a user, I want to use JavaScript to capture client-side events in my application 
* As a user, I want to see a graph of events for each registered application  

## Conclusion

Learning to create an API was very interesting and informative. It is amazing to uncover the power of Rails and all of the differnt things it can do. Learning to create an API will be very beneficial to take into new projects.
