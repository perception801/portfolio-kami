## Overview

"Mark IT" is a social bookmarking app that I created during my time at Bloc. As a personal challenge I decided to icorporate Redis into this app. This is a social bookmarking application in which users can email a URL and Mark IT will save it. It also allows user to upgrade their account using Stripe. This allows users to create private wikis while also adding the ability to collaborate with other users. 

## Personal Learning Objectives

My objectives for this project were to familiarize myself with Redis, and stripe,  as well as continue to improve my overall skills. 

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email. 
* As a user, I want to sign in and out of Blocmarks.
* As a user, I want to email a URL to Blocmarks and have it saved in the Blocmarks database.
* As a user, I want to see an index of all topics and their bookmarks.
* As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete bookmarks.
* As a user, I want to be the only one allowed to delete and update my bookmarks.
* As a user, I want to "like and unlike" bookmarks created by other users.
* As a user, I want to see a list of bookmarks on my personal profile that I've added or liked. 

## Conclusion

Learning to implement Redis was an eye opening experience. It is a very powerful tool that I will definitely implement again in future projects. Overall, this was a fun and challenging project.
