title: Becoming a Web Developer
---

My journey to become a web developer has been a long time coming. I have always had a passion for technology and even dabbled in HTML many years ago. After coming to the realization that my current job situation was not fulfilling, I decided to pursue web development full force. 

This process began with self study, and eventually led me to Treehouse. This provided me with a good foundation and helped me understand the ways that web development has advanced over the years. After, completing a few courses I realized that I had a passion for coding and it was something I found enjoyable. Although, I am an analytical person, creativity is something that drives me. To me coding in general is the best of both worlds. It is art. Art that requires an analytic and logical mindset. This seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. In order to reach my full potential, I decided I needed to learn from someone who has been there. I began to research coding bootcamp options and eventually settled on Bloc. 

The next posts will be about my journey with Bloc. Although, this is only the beginning I look forward to my new path in the web development world.
