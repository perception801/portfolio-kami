Hi. I'm Mike Roberts, a web developer currently located in Salt Lake City. I have a passion for building beautiful and functional products. I am constantly striving to challenge myself by learning and improving in any way I can. 

When I am not building things I enjoy music, basketball, and doing my best to live each and every day to the fullest. Questions? Comments? Random Thoughts? Feel free to drop me a line on my contact page.
